To configure the Java Plugin follow these steps:
Exit Firefox browser if it is already running.
Uninstall any previous installations of Java Plugin.
Only one Java Plugin can be used at a time. When you want to use a different plugin, or version of a plugin, remove the symbolic links to any other versions and create a fresh symbolic link to the new one.
 Create a symbolic link to the libnpjp2.so file in the browser plugins directory
Go to the plugins sub-directory under the Firefox installation directory
cd <Firefox installation directory>/plugins
Create plugins directory if it does not exist.
Create the symbolic link 
 ln -s <Java installation directory>/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so
Note: If you are upgrading your Java version then before creating new symbolic link you should remove old symbolic link to enable latest downloaded Java.
