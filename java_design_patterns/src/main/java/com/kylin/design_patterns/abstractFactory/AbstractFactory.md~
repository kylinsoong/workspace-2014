Abstract Factory
----------------

Sets of methods to make various objects. 

An abstract factory has sets of methods to make families of various objects.

In this example the AbstractSoupFactory defines the method names and return types to make various kinds of soup. 

The BostonConcreteSoupFactory and the HonoluluConcreteSoupFactory both extend the AbstractSoupFactory.
