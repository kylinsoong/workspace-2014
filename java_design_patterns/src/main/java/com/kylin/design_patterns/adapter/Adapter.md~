Adapter
-------

A class extends another class, takes in an object, and makes the taken object behave like the extended class.

In the Adapter Design Pattern, a class converts the interface of one class to be what another class expects. 

The adapter does this by taking an instance of the class to be converted (the adaptee) and uses the methods the adaptee has available to create the methods which are expected.
