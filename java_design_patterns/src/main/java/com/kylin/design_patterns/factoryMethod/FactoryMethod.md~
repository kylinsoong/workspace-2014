Factory Method
--------------

Methods to make and return components of one object various ways. 

In this example the SoupFactoryMethod defines the makeSoupBuffet method which returns a SoupBuffet object. The SoupFactoryMethod also defines the methods needed in creating the SoupBuffet. 

The BostonSoupFactoryMethodSubclass and the HonoluluSoupFactoryMethodSubclass both extend the SoupFactoryMethod. An object can be defined as an SoupFactoryMethod, and instantiated as either a BostonSoupFactoryMethodSubclass (BSFMS) or a HonoluluSoupFactoryMethodSubclass (HSFMS).
