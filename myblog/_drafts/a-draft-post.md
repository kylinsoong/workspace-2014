title:  "How to work with drafts"

This is a draft post.

To preview your site with drafts, simply run `jekyll serve` or `jekyll build` with the `--drafts` switch. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.
